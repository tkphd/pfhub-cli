      Benchmark problems vetted by the community to test, validate and
      verify phase field codes (read the journal pulication entitled
      ["Benchmark problems for numerical implementations of phase field models"](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.commatsci.2016.09.022){:target="_blank"}

      Codes with well documented, annotated examples that demonstrate
      the phase field method. See the
      [submission page](submit_a_new_code){:target="_blank"} to submit
      a new code to this list.

In January 2015 a group of phase field theorists and code developers
met at Northwestern University to discuss ways for the community to
improve code collaboration efforts. Everyone agreed that the community
needs to become more open and work in a more collaborative manner.

A key factor to improving community code collaboration is to develop
resources to compare and contrast phase field codes and
libraries. This site aims to provide some of these resources and
become a useful web service for phase field practitioners.

title: "About the CHiMad Phase Field website"
layout: essay
comment:
---

The primary goal of this site is to provide a set of benchmark
problems to compare and contrast codes for solving phase field
equations. Further goals include

 - providing tools for comparing phase field codes based on performance
   and accuracy,

 - providing practical educational material for phase field
   practitioners,

 - and generating an engaged and coordinated phase field community.

<h4> Get Involved </h4>

All those interested in phase field modeling are welcome to
participate in the community. See the [involvement guide]({{
site.baseurl }}/INVOLVEMENT) for more details.

<h4> Community </h4>

Please see the [community page]({{ site.baseurl }}/community) for
details of individuals involved in this project and their
affiliations.

<h4> Code of Conduct </h4>

We have a code of conduct and take it very seriously. Please the [code
of conduct page]({{ site.baseurl}}/CODE_OF_CONDUCT) for further
details.

<h4> Suggested Phase Field Codes </h4>

The goal of this site is to generate benchmarks, but also to evaluate
codes that solve phase field problems. We have a list of recommend
codes that have been used to solve some of the benchmarks.

<h4> FAQ </h4>

<h5> Which code should I use to solve my phase field problem? </h5>

We don't have the answer to this question yet. We are working on
this. We have a list of phase field codes and also a list of benchmark
results that might help you evaluate which code might work best for
you.

<h5> I don't like one of the benchmark problems. Can I help fix it? </h5>

Yes. Your feedback on the benchmark problems is highly valued. The
benchmarks are a moving target that you can contribute to. If you
would like to propose a change or improvement then please raise it via
chat or as an issue. The community will discuss the change and act on it if
we can reach a consensus

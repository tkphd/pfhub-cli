# CHiMaD - Phase Field

This repository is the basis for a website for the CHiMaD - Phase
Field group that met at the workshop in January 2015. See the [PDF
file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4101gT3tHveaGhmajZ4cE1fQWM/view?usp=sharing)
describing the workshop.

We aim to address the following issues:

 * collate data comparing code capabilities

 * collate date about phase field developers

 * finalize a set of canonical phase field examples

 * push scripts, recipes (IPython notebooks for example) for building
   and running phase field codes that solve the canonical examples (or
   any other phase field examples)

 * link to virtual machines for phase field codes

 * store phase field meta analysis on such things as efficiency
   (memory use), convergence, capabilities or ease of use

 * eventually include meta analysis tools for automated testing of
   multiple phase field codes

 * eventually include a generic high level API to describe phase field
   problems with hooks into multiple codes

          In January 2015 a group of phase field theorists and code
          developers met at Northwestern University to discuss ways
          for the community to improve code collaboration
          efforts. Everyone agreed that the community needs to become
          more open and work in a more collaborative manner.
        </p>
        <p>
          A key factor to improving community code collaboration is to
          develop resources to compare and contrast phase field codes
          and libraries. This site aims to provide some of these
          resources and become a useful web service for phase field
          practitioners.

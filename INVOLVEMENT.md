All those interested in phase field modeling are welcome to participate
or join our discussions. Those involved in graduate or postgraduate
work involving studying or implementing phase field problems are
especially welcome.  We value all forms of productive input. There are
a number of ways to get involved.

<h4> Uploading Benchmark Results </h4>

The most significant way to contribute is by trying to implement the
[benchmark problems]({{ site.baseurl}}/#benchmarks) using one of the
[suggested codes]({{ site.baseurl}}/codes) or your own custom code and
then [uploading the
results]({{ site.baseurl }}/simulations/upload_form/)
to the website.

<h4> Chat </h4>

We have active discussion on [Gitter chat
channel](https://gitter.im/usnistgov/chimad-phase-field). Feel free to
ask questions here.

<h4> Chat Meetings </h4>

We hold monthly [chat meetings on
Gitter](https://github.com/usnistgov/chimad-phase-field/wiki#chat-meetings). Please
try and participate if you'd like to get involved with our group.

<h4> Mailing List </h4>

Please subscribe to the [mailing
list]({{ site.baseurl }}/mailing_list/) if you'd
like to stay informed about meetings and workshops or just to ask
questions.

<h4> Via GitHub </h4>

Please feel free to [open an issue on
GitHub](https://github.com/usnistgov/chimad-phase-field/issues/new) if
you would like to raise a problem with one of [the benchmarks]({{
site.baseurl }}/#benchmarks) or with anything at all about the
website.

<h4> Workshops </h4>

An integral component of the CHiMaD phase field benchmarking effort is
regular [workshops]({{ site.baseurl }}/workshops) and associated
[hackathons]({{ site.baseurl }}/hackathons). Approximately twice a
year, a spectrum of United States and international researchers,
ranging from graduate students to senior scientists, come together to
participate. See the [workshops page]({{ site.baseurl }}/workshops) for details about past workshops
and plans for future workshops.

<h4> Website Development </h4>

The development of this website is a community effort. Please see the
[development guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/DEVELOPMENT) if you would like
to help out.

# This is a draft schema for PFHub, based on the Schema.org
# [DataCatalog](https://schema.org/DataCatalog) type.
#
# This "recipe" is intended for use with the
# [schemaorg](https://github.com/openschemas/schemaorg) Python library.
# The [extractor library](https://github.com/openschemas/extractors)
# for schemaorg includes more examples to build from.
#
# Bare list items (`- type`) are matched to the Schema.org type of the same
# name. Defined list items (`- item: type`) map the local term to the named
# Schema.org type.

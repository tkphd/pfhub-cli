---

### Requirements

The main requirements for listing a code are that the code includes an
[open source license](http://choosealicense.com){:target="_blank"}, is
available via a public repository and includes annotated phase field
examples.

### How to Submit

To add a code to the list, update the
[`codes.yaml`](https://github.com/usnistgov/chimad-phase-field/blob/gh-pages/data/codes.yaml){:target="_blank"}
file via the GitHub repository for this web site and submit a
pull-request.

The YAML file includes fields for the name of the code, a link to an
image logo, a description and a home page. Badges can be added for
services such as [Openhub](https://www.openhub.net){:target="_blank"}
and [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org){:target="_blank"}. Please
include the license badge and an
[Openhub](https://www.openhub.net){:target="_blank"} badge at a
minimum. Also, include links to any available annotated phase field
examples.

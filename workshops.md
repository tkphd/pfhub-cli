The workshops and associated [hackathons]({{ site.baseurl
}}/hackathons) are integral to the development effort of the [phase
field benchmark problems]({{ site.baseurl }}/#benchmarks). The
workshops bring together a spectrum of researchers from across the
United States and internationally, including both graduate students
and senior researchers. They help us formulate, test, and revise the
benchmark problems and provide other feedback, such as information for
developers of open-source codes on how easily their codes can be
installed. Significant portions of the workshop are devoted to
discussion, which provide a chance for the community to become more
integrated and allow us to work together to determine future needs and
avenues of work.

An integral component of the CHiMaD [phase field benchmarking effort]({{ site.baseurl }}/#benchmarks)
is regular workshops and associated [hackathons]({{ site.baseurl
}}/hackathons).  Approximately twice a year, a spectrum of researchers
from across the United States and internationally, including both
graduate students and senior researchers, come together to participate.
Workshops help us formulate, test, and revise the benchmark problems and
allow a valuable venue for other feedback to be provided, such as
information for developers of open-source codes on how easily their
codes can be installed. Significant portions of the workshop are devoted to
discussion, which provide a chance for the community to become more
integrated and allow us to work together to determine future needs and
avenues of work.

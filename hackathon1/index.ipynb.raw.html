<h2 id="Overview">Overview<a class="anchor-link" href="#Overview">&#182;</a></h2><p>CHiMaD hosted the first Phase Field Methods Hackathon on
October 14, 2015. The motivation for the hackathon came
from one of CHiMaDâ€™s missions: to develop community
standards for phase field modeling in materials science, and
to distribute community codes for phase field modeling. As
a first step along this mission, CHiMaD is working on devel-
oping and distributing a set of standard problems for phase
field modeling.</p>
<h2 id="Format">Format<a class="anchor-link" href="#Format">&#182;</a></h2><p>Teams consisting of two students or postdocs were
given a set of problems consisting of two kinds of
phase field modeling; each set contained sub-
problems of increasing difficulty. The problems
were (intended to be!) completely defined in terms
of initial conditions, geometry, and material pa-
rameters. The teams had 24 hours to solve the
problems using whatever numerical codes they had
at their disposition (with full access to the internet) - there were no codes provided at the hackathon.
All attendees were expected to bring their own lap-
tops and connect to the servers they regularly use
for running their codes.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion<a class="anchor-link" href="#Conclusion">&#182;</a></h2><p>The goal of the hackathon was to see how different
codes and different approaches could handle the
problems with respect to accuracy and speed. The
aim of the hackathon was not to produce winners or
losers, but to advance our understanding of phase
field modeling: in that context, all results or at-
tempts at solving the problems were valuable. In
this first iteration, we learned the most about how to
define the problems themselves to even be able to
have a successful exercise.</p>

I've made these changes [1] based on the reviewers' comments. Point by
point,

> 1, Improve the introduction to include better information on a)
> phase-field codes, b) the phase-field code community, c) the need
> for a phase-field hub framework, and d) the need for a template for
> other communities.

Added paragraph of text about phase field [2] which should cover a),
b) and c). Added a paragraph of text on why a template for other
communities is required [3].

> 2, Provide more detail on CoffeeScript and on what "appropriate
> tools" for linting and testing the CoffeeScript front-end are.

Provided links to appropriate tools [4] and sentence about
Coffeescript [5].

> 3, Improve documentation on deployment to include but not limited to
> screenshots showing the current deployment, and the dependency graph
> of the project.

Added screenshots [6] and link to the development guide [7]. Updated
link to the dependency graph and made it easier to view [8].

> 4, Make sure that the link to the license is working.

This [9] works fine for me.

> 5, Provide simple input and output data. This does not have to be
> include in the git repository as it is not useful to have large data
> files there but could be put on Zenodo.

Added links to typical upload data [10] and typical display data [11].
